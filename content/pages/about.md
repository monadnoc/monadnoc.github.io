title: about(me)

email = jn.1290[at]gmail.com

My parents gave me my name by pre-pending 'Jordan' to 'Nicholas Nelson' because 'Nick Nelson' sounded too much like 'Nick Nolte,'so they Hollywood ruined their first choice. Their nominal inspiration came near the time of my birth (Dec 1990) when they were shopping at 'Jordan Marsh'&mdash;cropped JM's death-throes logo for the favicon on this site. 

Passionate about Chemistry, Data Science, and Teaching (with a capital 'T'), I'm using this site as an outlet for these things and more.
<br>I'm wedded to Chicago at the moment, and if I can't find a teaching position in Chemistry, I'm looking for an internship in Data Science.

I'll leave you with a snippet I wrote for my Airbnb profile in 2014 that still rings true today
